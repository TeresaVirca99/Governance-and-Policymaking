# Policy Brief: Improving the UK's Air Quality Policy

## Overview

This repository contains a policy brief written as part of the Governance and Policymaking course at Tilburg University, as part of the MSc Data Science and Society program. The assignment focused on presenting a data science solution to a significant societal issue.

## Project Description

The policy brief addresses the urgent need for improvements in the UK's air quality policy, particularly in light of the 2021 Environment Act. It highlights the ongoing challenges the UK faces in meeting international air quality standards and the shortcomings in assessing the effectiveness of current interventions.

In response to the climate crisis and the wealth of available air quality and IoT data, the brief proposes the development of an air quality Digital Twin. By leveraging real-time data and advanced visualization tools, this approach aims to enhance policymakers' understanding of the impacts of air quality interventions and to inform more targeted and effective policies.

The brief also emphasizes the importance of collaboration between key public agencies, specifically advocating for closer cooperation between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).
